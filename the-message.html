                "It is Monday today, 23rd March 2020. I am writing this message as a side-note of a birthday present that I am not sure I will be able to deliver in time or not. Strange we plan the presents giving our most, but it is merely the words that define our solicitude for each other.",
                "We, Humans, are very enigmatic by nature. We spend our lives building up a personality that is unique to this world. But when it comes to interaction with the people around us, we try to blend into their interests, their likings and their expectations. Little do we know that the charm that stands distinctive to our character - the exclusiveness, is a carved gem of the experiences, circumstances and a past only specific to us.",
                "We believe it or not, we have all been there. Escape? Certainly, yes. There comes a time of realization when we all reconsider who we matter to, for whom we do not need any blends and in fact just where we feel celebrated not tolerated. That is called \"metanoia\".",
                "I have also watched you pass through metanoia stage of your life. While it is favourable to be versatile, you must know that you do not have to adapt yourself into others' expectations - things I learned from numerous setbacks. The individuality you carry within you, is yours. Less, but yours! I am positive that you are going to stand out.<br> You. Are. Going. To. Shine.",
                "Everyone goes through some struggles in their life but to have a friend like you by my side has always been the best feeling ever. The one who motivates, the one who has a good humour and above all the one who has this beautiful vulnerability of having unmatched care and concern for everyone around."
